**Quick Little Notebook 1.0**

A quick little CLI notebook for quick little thoughts...

To write notebook entries, enter `qln notebook_name "text to save"` in the command line. If the notebook named does not already exist, a plain text file will be instantiated within the user directory. The entry is saved alongside a UTC timestamp. The notebook can be read as a regular text file at `~/Documents/qln/notebook_name.txt`.
